                    <h2>The City of Reykjavik</h2>
                    <p>We first arived in Reykjavik, which is the only major city in Iceland. We saw a lot of cool arcitecture
                        and went to some resturaunts. The city is know to have a pretty great nightlife. Unfortunately, my group
                        had to leave for our Airbnb the same day which was in the countryside, so we didn't get to experience the 
                        bar seen. (Next time.)

                    <h2>Our Airbnb</h2>
                    <p>
                        After renting a half-broken van from a company literally named "Sad Car," we drove a couple hours to our Airbnb.
                        The hope was nice, but the view was better. The picture below does not do it justice. Iceland's countryside is
                        beautiful and has rolling hills of farmland and mountains in the distance. It's also light out for the entire day in
                        the summer time. The sun just moves around the horizon, so it always looks like a sunset.

                    <h2>Our Neighbor's Dog</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our neighbors had this sheppard farm dog. He was super friendly and an unexpected highlight of the trip. One day our van wouldn't
                        start and we didn't have any cellphone service to call for help. Some buddies and I walked 4.7 miles
                        to the closest town for help, and this dog followed us the whole way. It was pretty great. The only 
                        problem was that when we finally got the car fixed, we had to leave him behind at the house. He came 
                        running after the van barking. We couln't explain to him why we weren't taking him with us and I still
                        feel bad to this day.

                    <h2>Waterfalls</h2>
                    <p>
                        We visited a lot of different geographical landmarks around Iceland, a few of which were waterfalls.
                        In the summer, water from melting snow and ice comes down from the mountains. The water is crystal clear.
                        We ended up drinking some of it and it was better than Dasani and Aquafina. Not that that's saying much.

                    <h2>The Black Sand Beach</h2>
                    <p>
                        The last stop on our tour of the coast was a black sand beach called "Reynisfjara." It's off the Atlantic Ocean,
                        so the whater was very cold. A friend and I went swimming for about 30 seconds before running back out of
                        the water.
